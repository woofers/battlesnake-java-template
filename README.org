* Battle Snake 2019

@@html:<img height="120" width="120" src="https://github.com/woofers/battle-snake-2019/blob/master/screenshots/intermediate.png?raw=true" />@@

A simple [[https://www.battlesnake.io][BattleSnake]] written in Java.
Will be entered in the 2019 Intermediate competition as *Liquid Snake*.

Deployed to =https://battlesnake-liquid.herokuapp.com/=

** Strategy

Our snake's strategy was aggresive. For each turn, if the snake wasn't
the largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific
threshold, the snake would navigate towards the closest food. Otherwise,
it would try to target the other snakes' heads to either eliminate the
opponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path.
The snake also included an unused passive state, where she would try to
loop back around to her tail to avoid collisions.

*** Drawbacks

The snake's biggest drawback was trapping itself in its own tail. We
didn't implement an effective algorithm to calculate dangerous regions
of the board, and ultimately the snake died by going for takedowns and
boxing itself in.
