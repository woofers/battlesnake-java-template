* Battlesnake Template

@@html:<img height="120" width="120" src="screenshots/advanced.png" />@@

A un-official [[https://www.battlesnake.io][Battlesnake]] template written in Java.

Battlesnake documentation can be found at [[https://docs.battlesnake.io][docs.battlesnake.io]].

[[https://heroku.com/deploy][https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png]]

** About

This template is different from the official Java [[https://github.com/battlesnakeio/starter-snake-java][Battlesnake.io Template]] in a few ways:

- GSON is used for JSON serialization rather than Jackson
- Pure Java Servlets are used rather than the Spark Framework
- Tomcat is used as the servlet container rather than Jetty which is used by default by Spark
- Gradle is used as the build tool rather than Maven

The official Java [[https://github.com/battlesnakeio/starter-snake-java][Template]] is also simpler and smaller
however this template comes out-of-the-box with the following additional features:

- Logging support using Log4j2
- Logs server response time
- Code formatting, removing used imports using spotless

** Usage

2. Install Docker + Docker compose (required for [[sec:docker][Docker container method]])
